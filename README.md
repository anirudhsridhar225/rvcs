# Resume Version Control System

This is a git-like version control system for your resume/CV. You can have it saved as versions (using latex to make the resume) and cherry-pick old versions etc.

This is built on the Java Spring framework, using JPA/Hibernate and Lombok for the db integrations/migrations/operations etc.
